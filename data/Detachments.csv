000000909|AC|Voyagers in Darkness|<b>Some shield companies of the Adeptus Custodes set sail into the darkness between the stars, either guided by visions of the Emperor’s will or believing that they can do the most to defend Terra by seeking out and destroying distant threats.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000910|AC|Black Ship Guardians|<b>Whether fighting furiously to prevent enemies from boarding one of the sinister Black Ships and freeing its psyker inmates, or sweeping into an enemy vessel or installation to seize and imprison powerful witches, the Sisters of Silence are a force to be reckoned with in void warfare.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000986|AC|Solar Spearhead|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Within the deepest engine vaults of the Imperial Palace, the ancient and mighty vehicles of the Custodians reside. Auramite-clad combat walkers bristling with arcane weapons are roused from stasis, ready to be unleashed upon the galaxy’s battlefields. Venerable Land Raiders as old as the Imperium are awoken by complex rituals and prepared for war. When battle dawns, these dread engines of destruction stride or rumble towards the cowering foe, their guns emitting furious torrents of destruction. Those brave or foolish enough to stand before this armoured spearhead are crushed beneath the tread of auric battle tanks or smashed to a bloody pulp by wrathful interred champions.</p>||
000001029|AC|Lions of the Emperor|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Many of the galaxy’s warrior cultures accept the time-honoured truth that there is greater strength in numbers. Not so for the champions of the Adeptus Custodes, the Lions of the Emperor. Each of them is an army unto themselves, a warrior of legend gifted with terrifying strength, armoured in nigh-impenetrable golden plate and possessing limitless resolve. When the greatest Custodians take to the field at once, those auric-armoured champions have no need to pool their resources in order to smite their foes. Relying instead upon their superhuman strength and mastery of martial ka’tahs, they hurl themselves into the midst of the enemy, sweeping aside gunlines, eviscerating rampaging monsters and obliterating enemy war machines with terrifying ease.</p>||

000000912|AdM|Electromartyrs|<b>When precious technoreliquaries must be protected or rare archeotech seized in shipboard battles, Tech-Priests quickly cast aside whatever restraint they may have had. Lesser underlings are expended without a care and perilous technologies unleashed in the quest for higher knowledge.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000913|AdM|Response Clade|<b>Just as white blood cells will defend a Human body, so the clades of Skitarii embedded on Adeptus Mechanicus vessels respond with systematic aggression to enemy intrusions. Once their own ship is secure, they are capable of counterboarding operations to destroy the threat at its source.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000914|AdM|Machine Cult|<b>The voidships of the Adeptus Mechanicus are as much spacegoing temples to the Omnissiah as they are floating forges or esoteric warships. The teeming tech-clergy aboard such ships form zealous armies in their own right, responding with fanatical aggression to any foe.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000984|AdM|Haloscreed Battle Clade|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Tech-Priests often monitor their forces remotely, but those who lead battle clades take this intervention to an extreme, exerting even finer control over their thralls. Projecting fragments of their consciousness through the noospheric battle-sphere, they override the autonomy of their soldiery and inload tactical information, target coordinates and vector directives into cybernetic minds. Such assistance is gratefully received by the Machine God’s faithful, who feel blessed by the rush of divine wisdom and implanted knowledge.</p>||
000000919|AE|Khaine’s Arrow|<b>Honed to a single, perfect point, the Aeldari Aspect Warriors streak across the void of space aboard Vampire Raiders before plunging deep into the heart of the enemy ship. Perhaps they strike the bridge. Maybe they pierce the defences of the enginarium. Wherever they hit home, they bring doom to the foe.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000920|AE|Protector Host|<b>The Aeldari fight furiously to defend their irreplaceable voidships - doubly so if the conflict threatens one of their spacefaring craftworlds. In such a battle they deploy their full might without a second thought, citizen soldiery and Aspect Warriors alike rallying to defend that which is precious to them.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000921|AE|Wraiths of the Void|<b>When a void battle is sufficiently vital or desperate, the Aeldari awaken their wraith constructs. Resilient, powerful and utterly focused upon their duty, such ghost warriors are a force of unimaginable devastation amidst the close confines of a boarding battle.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000922|AE|Star-dancer Masque|<b>When Harlequins board an enemy ship they follow Saedath that cast them in the roles of void-soaring mythic hawks and serpents, or else the heroes Ulthanash and Eldanesh raiding the stronghold of some monstrous foe. They flow through the steps with blistering speed, laying low all who oppose them.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000990|AE|Armoured Warhost|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When unleashed upon the battlefield in number, the vehicles of the Aeldari can bring a terrifying volume of firepower to bear with exceptional speed. As supersonic Aeldari aircraft suppress the enemy with strafing and bombing runs, sleek battle-skimmers sweep low across war-scarred terrain, hunting down and obliterating their targets with scintillating volleys. Successive waves of armoured transports follow, their shields and wraithbone hulls turning aside incoming munitions as they sweep low to disgorge waves of Aspect Warriors and Guardian soldiers into the fight. As the Aeldari infantry move to seize their objectives and annihilate the enemy, agile walkers sprint towards the flanks of the overwhelmed foe, their guns spitting vibrant streams of enfilading fire into massed enemies and ensuring that none escape the wrath of the Asuryani.</p>||
000001017|AE|Warhost|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When all the varied warriors and war machines of a craftworld gather to fight in its defence, they form a Warhost. Exemplified by the dreaded Swordwind of Biel-Tan, these armies alloy many specialised units into a greater whole that combines precisely applied martial might with blistering speed. The result is a force that - often outnumbered - possesses every weapon it requires to achieve victory, guided by the skilled hands and gifted minds of those who can seize it. Cold-eyed Guardians secure vital strategic sites and defend them with salvoes of firepower. Streaking assault craft fill the skies, jetbike-mounted warriors slashing through the enemy ranks. At the same time, grav-tanks wheel gracefully to pick off enemy war engines or debark squads of elite Aspect Warriors precisely where and when they are needed. Supported by eldritch artillery and psychic might, the Warhost strikes the foe a series of crippling blows while evading their clumsy attacks in return, until soon enough, the battle’s outcome is beyond any doubt.</p>||
000001018|AE|Windrider Host|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Squadrons of jetbikes slice the air like hurled daggers as the Windrider Host sweeps down upon its prey. Prioritising breathtaking speed over almost all other concerns, these formations of high-tech airborne cavalry strike at will along the enemy battle line. Their onset is shockingly sudden, a storm that rises with the scream of anti-grav engines and the whine of rapid-firing shuriken and laser weapons, then sweeps over the foe in eruptions of blood and terror. Faster than thought, the Windrider Host has overshot the foe and arced away to leave any threat of retribution foundering in its wake. Often, the Aeldari hit their enemies so hard and fast that jets of gore are still pattering to the ground, corpses still tumbling, and war engines only just starting to shake with detonations as the jetbikes dwindle into the distance. Yet this is not the end of the foe’s suffering, but rather its beginning. The Windrider Host will return, arrowing in for another attack run again and again until all that remains of the enemy is bodies, wreckage, and fleeing remnants.</p>||
000001019|AE|Spirit Conclave|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Only in the most desperate circumstances will a craftworld’s seers authorise the mass awakening of their dead. At such times, Spiritseers, Warlocks and Farseers come together as one, forming a psychic choir to bind the spirits of the fallen into wraithbone form. While living Aeldari often fight alongside these revenants, the greater strength of such forces is graven in wraithbone, driven by the implacable wills of warrior ghosts and armed with nightmarish tools of destruction. Striding into battle with stately grace, Wraithguard and Wraithlords lay down ferocious firepower. Where enemy resistance is strongest, Wraithblades stalk and strike while the long shadows of Wraithknights fall across the foe like a promise of doom soon to be fulfilled. Together, the psychically linked seers guide the slaughter with eerie calm, issuing command after command to their undying allies. In the face of such implacable destruction, and with their own mightiest weapons seemingly ineffective, even the boldest enemies soon crumble.</p>||
000001020|AE|Guardian Battlehost|<p class="ShowFluff legend">So few are the Aeldari in number and so desperate in their plight that all must be capable warriors when needed. Sometimes a foe may jeopardise a craftworld so severely that every martial asset must be deployed to drive them back. At others, threats or opportunities may arise in so short a space of time that Aspect Warriors, Outcasts and Commorrite allies alone are not enough. Whatever the case, when the massed Guardians of a craftworld answer the call to war, they can prove a versatile, durable and utterly determined force. Hails of shuriken fire and scatter laser salvoes rake the enemy lines. War Walkers and grav-tanks pick off heavier enemy assets with inescapable precision and fury. Aspect Warriors drawn from the shrines of the home craftworld fight in support of their more numerous kin, bands of Dire Avengers leading them on the fleet-footed attack or implacable defence. Faced with the might of the Guardian Battlehost, foes are made to rue their foolishness in rousing a craftworld’s wrath.</p>||
000001021|AE|Ghosts of the Webway|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Even a single troupe of Harlequins can spread bloodshed and unreasoning terror amongst the enemy lines. When entire masques of these sinister and acrobatic killers gather to make war, they strike with such speed, skill and violence that they can eviscerate the mightiest enemy armies. Their saedath battle plans are as dynamic and intricate as they are spectacularly lethal. Some see spearheads of hurtling jetbikes shatter the enemy lines before grav-transports disgorge Harlequin troupes to assassinate their reeling foes’ leaders. Others lure enemy hordes into bloody massacres laced with dramatic irony and bleak mirth or play out murderous recountings of Aeldari morality tales that cast the enemy as unwilling participants in the story of their bloody punishment. Whether fighting alone or alongside hosts from the craftworlds, Commorragh or Corsair fleets, the Harlequins strike without warning - or often, to the foe, apparent cause - and inflict such horrors that even their allies may be left shocked at the carnage.</p>||
000001022|AE|Devoted of Ynnead|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Those Aeldari who follow the extremist teachings of the priestess Yvraine seek to empower Ynnead, the Aeldari god of death. In the name of their morbid creed, they hurl themselves into battle, sure that not only is every enemy slain one less to menace the Aeldari but also that their own deaths will bring their god closer to waking. Perhaps the strength of fanatical conviction magnified by the Aeldari psyche allows Ynnead’s devotees to channel some fragment of his supernatural powers. Maybe it is the latent psychic potential of the Aeldari finding macabre expression or something more sinister at work. Whatever the case, while their numbers may be few and their death cult marginalised, the Ynnari demonstrate strange and deadly abilities in battle. Coupled with their people’s natural and technological puissance, this renders the Ynnari a terrible foe indeed. Moreover, they will know ultimate victory, whether they live to fight again or die for Ynnead’s cause.</p>||
000001023|AE|Seer Council|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Eldritch psychic storms tear at the enemy as the Seer Council leads their warriors into battle. Farseers deliver prophetic orders in voices of steely calm, guiding Aspect Warriors and Guardian squads to strike at crucial fate and causality junctures. Their every pronouncement seals the doom of fresh foes. Psychic executioners project their spirits through the Empyrean to destroy enemy champions’ souls or predict warring combatants’ battle fates. Warlocks lead their squads through the tightly focused maelstrom, singing spears lashing out and psychic fury crackling forth to deliver elegant and total destruction. Led by such a conclave of their most potent psykers, the Aeldari are unstoppable. They fight clad in the faded raiment of their once-mighty empire. The devastation they bring to bear echoes that their fallen ancestors once unleashed to put the galaxy on its knees; this is the Aeldari at their most potent, a terrifying psychic blade driven into the heart of the luckless foe.</p>||
000001024|AE|Aspect Host|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When the Avatar of Khaine strides out to war, the Aspect Warriors of many shrines fight in its cinder-swirled shadow. Squads of Dire Avengers rake their targets with storms of shuriken discs. Shrieking bands of Howling Banshees tear into the enemy’s front lines even as Striking Scorpions flit from ambush to rip bloody rents in their flanks. Fire Dragons unleash point-blank fury to reduce enemy war engines to blazing wrecks, while the long-ranged salvoes of Dark Reapers streak overhead to detonate amongst the foe. Swooping Hawks circle on the winds of war and launch opportunist strikes, Shining Spears and Crimson Hunters drive home hurtling attack runs, and Warp Spiders burst in and out of reality amidst monofilament clouds of death. Guided by the martial expertise of Autarchs and Exarchs, and supported by Guardian-crewed war engines and artillery, the devotees of Khaine’s many aspects pick their enemies apart with surgical precision. Coupled with the blazing devastation wrought by the Avatar itself, their onslaught is irresistible.</p>||

000000927|AM|Embarked Regiment|<b>Astra Militarum regiments spend months, even years, travelling aboard voidships between war zones.

000000928|AM|Tempestus Boarding Regiment|<b>The Militarum Tempestus excel in high-intensity, fast-moving raids. Some of their regiments further refine these specialisms towards the boarding of voidships, storming vital locations to seize and scuttle the vessel or extract vital personnel from the foe’s clutches.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000996|AM|Bridgehead Strike|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When the Astra Militarum launch rapid offensives, their attack routes are typically planned well in advance. Should a crucial bridge, mountain pass, supply depot or other essential landmark lie along their path, an elite force may be tasked to secure it ahead of the main push. The elite warriors of the Militarum Tempestus or equivalent specialist companies like the Cadian Kasrkin most often undertake such missions. Deploying via aircraft, grav-chutes or columns of fast armoured transports, the force hits their target zone hard, relying upon firepower and surprise to dislodge enemy defenders. With the site secured, the strike forces must hold their prize against whatever the foe hurls at them until the main strength of the Imperial host reaches their position and relieves them.</p>||

000000987|AoI|Veiled Blade Elimination Force|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The lethally efficient agents of the Officio Assassinorum ordinarily operate alone when stalking their prey. However, when assigned a particularly well-protected or formidable target, assassins from various temples may be brought together alongside other assets drawn from the military, Ecclesiarchal or judicial wings of the Imperium. These bespoke formations possess enough firepower to break through the target’s defences and ensure the killing blow is landed.</p>||

000001003|AS|Champions of Faith|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The Adepta Sororitas assemble their most skilled and pious warriors when a truly vital mission must be completed. Whether they muster in the marshalling cloisters of a holy shrine, aboard a dropship thundering through hostile skies, or even upon the open field of war amidst fountaining explosions and heaped corpses, these hand-picked champions of the Imperial Creed halt long enough to kneel as one and pray to the God-Emperor. Only once they have sworn irrevocable oaths to the Master of Mankind, promising they will die before failing him, do the Battle Sisters advance. Bound by the promises they have made and sure in the knowledge that they are the finest exemplars of their order, these Champions of Faith stride out with unshakeable purpose and fiercely focused determination to prevail no matter the cost.</p>||
000000779|CD|Daemonic Incursion|||
000000953|CD|Daemonic Incursion|<b>Warp travel is fraught with perils, the greatest of which is a breach of the voidship’s Geller fields. In but the beat of a mortal heart, scores of infernal entities manifest aboard the doomed ship, shrieking with predatory glee as they fall upon their victims.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000954|CD|Infernal Onslaught|<b>Whether it be aboard the echoing corridors of a space hulk, storming through the gothic confines of a loyalist warship, or spilling from the warp into a xenos vessel, such close-quarters violence draws the daemons of Khorne in great number.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000955|CD|Rotten and Rusted|<b>The daemons of the Plague God Nurgle slither through enemy voidships like seeping corruption given malevolent form.

000000956|CD|Dread Carnival|<b>Lithe and graceful, the daemons of Slaanesh cavort across the decks of enemy voidships, bombarding their victims’ senses with hypnotic dances and soporific aromas before butchering them in the most outlandishly gory fashion imaginable.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000957|CD|Pandaemoniac Inferno|<b>Once the daemons of Tzeentch are loose aboard a ship they spread like a kaleidoscopic firestorm. Their mad cackles meld with the screams of their victims as the daemons’ mutative touch twists both the infested voidship and the unfortunates who defend it, blending them amidst gruesome conflagrations of change.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000997|CD|Legion of Excess|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The legions of Slaanesh surge into battle like a blood-spattered carnival run mad. It is a revel where every swathe of diaphanous silk is braided with screaming souls, and every beautiful smile stretches into a needle-fanged leer of cruellest hunger. The presence of these entities is enough to drive mortals mad as the horrific evidence of their eyes wars with forbidden desire welling inside them like bile. Engulfed in intoxicating mists, they struggle to raise weapons against Daemonettes and Fiends whose every caress bears a razor’s edge. Wailing in blissful torment, they drop to their knees before towering Keepers of Secrets, pleading for gifts of agony the daemons gladly dole out. Willingly, they hurl themselves beneath the hooves of Seekers and the threshing blades of Hellflayers. Against such insidious foes, what hope of victory can there be?</p>||
000000998|CD|Scintillating Legion|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Capering and cackling in an endless flux of transmogrifying change, the daemonic legions of Tzeentch unleash kaleidoscopic madness upon their enemies. Malevolent Lords of Change robed in sanity-blasting unhues wield raw magic with the ease of breathing. They marshal their bedlam hordes even as they transform screaming mortals into mounds of mutant flesh or set light to reality itself. Pink, Blue and Brimstone Horrors dance amidst the leaping flames, their sorceries unleashed in scintillating bombardments alongside the mutagenic blasts of bounding Flamers. Blade-finned Screamers flit through the skies in spiteful shoals, wheeling around the Burning Chariots that streak into the enemy lines like multicoloured comets, while all around them, reality itself distorts into screaming insanity.</p>||
000000999|CD|Blood Legion|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The daemon legions of Khorne burst into realspace like blood from an artery. Bloodcrushers pound the ground as they lead the charge, slamming into the enemy lines with avalanche force. Behind them come snarling Flesh Hounds and gore-slick Bloodletters, the bellow of brazen war horns sounding their massed charge. Through the clangour of blades and screams, a new sound cuts the air as flaming skulls whistle down to explode amongst the enemy, spat from the maws of Skull Cannons to inflict maximum slaughter. Then, the dark shadow of outstretched wings spreads over the foe. Roaring bloody murder, the Bloodthirsters of Khorne slam down from on high to unleash carnage beyond the imaginings of mortal warriors. As severed heads tumble and blood falls like monsoon rain, crimson doom engulfs the enemy altogether.</p>||
000001000|CD|Plague Legion|<p class="ShowFluff legend">One moment, reality is a place of rationality. The next, the veil separating realspace from the Warp strains, then bursts like a fatted boil and from the suppurating rent spill the daemon legions of Nurgle. Despair spreads before them like vomit soaking into pristine silk. Miasmal clouds engulf the foe, causing flesh to blister and slough, metal to fur with rust, and hope itself to rot away into dread misery. Already disoriented and gripped by gloom, the enemy now faces rank upon rank of rotted horrors as Plaguebearers slouch toward them, shepherded by the mountainous bulks of Great Unclean Ones. With tittering tides of Nurglings flowing like sharp-fanged effluent about their legs, Beasts of Nurgle bounding through their lines like living boulders, and malevolent Plague Drones thrumming down from above, the enemy’s nightmare is just beginning.</p>||

000000991|CSM|Creations of Bile|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Comprising abhorrent warbands of augmented Chaos Space Marines, the varied creations of Bile display the depths of the Primogenitor’s dark genius. Whether devoted to Bile’s search for prize specimens and forbidden knowledge or bartered to ambitious warlords in return for great riches, these altered warriors expand the web of the Spider’s sinister influence. Each new experiment the Clonefather undertakes is intended to improve upon the works of the Corpse-Emperor and render the transhuman form of a Space Marine more lethal. In battle, his creations utilise their enhanced strength, speed, aggression and endurance to weather fields of killing fire, plunge into the midst of the enemy and tear their victims apart, even as the genetic mutations induced by the Clonefather begin to overwhelm their altered forms.</p>||
000001058|CSM|Cabal of Chaos|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Even a single Chaos Space Marine Sorcerer is a powerful champion of the Dark Gods, capable of channelling the energies of the Warp into blasts of infernal flame and nightmarish curses of mutation. When multiple Sorcerers gather, their powers are magnified. Reality itself convulses at their command. Enemy warriors are torn asunder by storms of empyric power, as the battlefield writhes in unnatural mutation. While a lone Sorcerer often acts as the advisor to a powerful Chaos Lord, cabals such as this possess the combined might and forbidden knowledge to rule over armies or even entire worlds. Accompanied by their chosen lieutenants and defended by those they consider their servants, the Sorcerers unleash their hosts to conquer unsuspecting worlds, ransack ancient repositories of knowledge, and expand their malevolent powers even more.</p>||
000000930|DG|Vectors of Decay|<b>The Death Guard are well-practised in shipboard warfare and punishing boarding actions.

000000931|DG|Unclean Uprising|<b>Under the corrupting influence of Nurgle’s worshippers, voidships can sicken just like living bodies. Corridors awash with chanting, diseased cultists, chambers and vital systems clogged by rancid entities and plague-spawned filth, even the most redoubtable warship can sicken and die.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000932|DG|Arch-Contaminators|<b>Spearheading assaults onto enemy voidships or digging in to defend the most vital of their own plague ships’ systems and chambers, these chosen of Mortarion are as indomitable as they are foul. No foe can long endure their feculent ferocity.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000980|DG|Flyblown Host|<p class="ShowFluff legend">As the Death Guard stride inexorably towards their foes, the battlefield thrums and buzzes with the wingbeats of a trillion swollen flies. Bloated and mutated Plague Marines march beneath a pathogenic haze, striding forward slowly and purposefully, unleashing precise salvoes of diseased projectiles. The obscuring swarms foul the foe’s return fire, and whatever clots of contagion their desperate shots manage to clear away are filled moments later by yet more hovering vermin. Amidst the droning miasma, the Death Guard stride on, at one with the crawling and buzzing horror surrounding them. As the horrifying cloud washes over the enemy, their warriors retch and claw at their skin. The Plague Marines exploit the distraction ruthlessly, cutting down their stricken foes and leaving nothing but rotting corpses in their wake.</p>||
000001049|DG|Virulent Vectorium|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Many Death Guard vectoriums boast a mix of heavy infantry, armoured might and twisted champions of supernatural disease. Led by a mighty Lord of the Legion - or sometimes even a thrice-favoured Daemon Prince - such warbands accumulate the favour of the Plague God with every repulsive feat of conquest. Their festering star rises as they do, and the diseases that sing through their bloated bodies wax fat with power. Their weaponised maladies roll before them like a rancid flood, surging through the enemy ranks to leave the mightiest warriors shuddering and sweating as buboes erupt from their flesh. Even the battlefield itself sickens at the touch of such corrupt beings: greenery rots and runs into lakes of bubbling slime, mud churns with pus-moist larvae as long as a Human arm, ruins fur with mould and begin to crumble, while vehicle wrecks rust and the bodies of the fallen bloat and burst to spray infectious filth. Amidst such riotous putrefaction, the warriors of the Death Guard drone their praises to Nurgle and fight all the harder.</p>||
000001050|DG|Mortarion’s Hammer|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The armoured might of the Death Guard has warped and corroded over the millennia, but it remains prodigious. Formed into grinding spearheads and smog-belching batteries, squadrons of ancient battle tanks and Daemon Engines mass their blunt and brutish power before unleashing it on the foe. Their onslaught is heralded by a rain of rust-pocked artillery shells, alchemical munitions and brittleglass plague-spheres hurled from infernal field guns and towering Daemon Engines behind the lines. The foe cower beneath this explosive deluge, many torn apart by thunderous detonations or eaten away by whirling spore clouds. Amid the devastation surge reaper colonies of Plague Marines mounted in Rhinos and Land Raiders. These warriors are masters of capitalising upon their foes’ dismay and horror, tearing the guts out of the most formidable defence lines even as carrion-feeding war engines close in to finish off knots of resistance. Many a siege has been swiftly broken in this way by the fall of Mortarion’s Hammer.</p>||
000001051|DG|Champions of Contagion|<p class="ShowFluff legend">There are many ways to worship Nurgle: the brewing of virulent plagues, the foul perversion of the surgeon’s craft, sharing the abundance of unfettered sickness with armies of foes; the champions of the Death Guard practise these and many other expressions of the Plague Lord’s faith. A vectorium rich in these diabolical madmen can unleash the full horror of the Legion’s alchemical, biological and sorcerous weapons. Foul Blightspawn lumber amidst their comrades, their excremental reek heralding the jetting corrosive sprays of their weapons. Noxious Blightbringers toll their tocsins of misery, battering the foe with entropic shock waves even as Biologus Putrifiers caper through their ranks to fling brittleglass alembics and jab the needles of their injector pistols into promising victims. All the while, the droning count of the Tallymen booms out through rusted vox-emitters, and Plague Surgeons ply their macabre trade, even as their fellow Plague Marines storm relentlessly forward over the withered and maddened remnants of the foe.</p>||
000001052|DG|Tallyband Summoners|<p class="ShowFluff legend">There are many ways for the daemons of Nurgle to burst the bounds of reality and fight alongside the Death Guard. Sometimes, they are conjured by the concentration of sickness and misery unleashed by Mortarion’s sons. At others, their Tally bands may be summoned by a champion of the Death Guard reading aloud from the mouldering pages of one of the seven Books of Woe or through a ritual offering of diseased or despairing souls. Regardless of how these entities find their way to the battlefield, they plague all living things. The mere sight of Great Unclean Ones a stomping into battle like swaying mountains of rotted flab can be enough to blast the sanity of the foe. The onset of gruesome Plaguebearers, fleshy avalanches of spiteful Nurglings, bounding packs of Beasts of Nurgle, and thrumming swarms of Plague Drones proves impossible for even the most resolute enemy to halt. Even should some brave victims stand their ground, they will not last long before the ferociously infectious attentions of these befouling entities.</p>||
000001053|DG|Shamblerot Vectorium|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Many vectoriums unleash heaving swarms of Poxwalkers to soften up and encircle their foes. The first the enemy knows of such an onslaught is the stink of diseased flesh upon the air, mingled with the agonised groans of countless plague-ridden mutants. Then they come - spilling from doorways and windows, boiling up from sewer outlets, trench networks and subterranean transit networks, crawling out of vehicle wrecks and rising from carrion heaps; thousands upon thousands of Poxwalkers converging on the foe at a stumbling yet relentless pace. Engulfed in a sea of grasping hands, biting maws and bloated flesh, even the finest strategies of the foe falter and fail. The enemy finds themselves forced into a battle for survival as they strive to fend off the Poxwalkers closing in from every side. It is at this point that the Death Guard themselves strike. Off balance, broken into desperate pockets and running low on ammunition, the foe has little hope of standing against this second, more punishing onslaught.</p>||
000001054|DG|Death Lord’s Chosen|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The mightiest champions of the Death Guard are as formidable in battle as they are bloated with the infectious blessings of Nurgle. When they congeal into a unified fighting force, these dread warriors become the grim and relentless will of Mortarion made manifest. Such a vectorium is quite capable of conquering an enemy flagship or command fortress, launching assassination strikes against crucial enemy personnel or breaking into the most heavily defended sacred sites. It is not unusual for Mortarion’s champions to turn the course of an entire war with a single shock onslaught or immovable defensive action; this is most likely when the Daemon Primarch leads in person. With their gene-sire’s jaundiced gaze weighing heavy upon them, bands of Deathshroud and Blightlord Terminators tear an unstoppable path through the foe. Supported by hand-picked squads of Plague Marines, bellowing Helbrutes and twisted champions, they sweep aside all who stand in their path.</p>||
000000831|DRU|Skysplinter Assault|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Many raiding parties swoop upon their victims aboard fleets of speeding anti-grav skimmers. Bands of Drukhari ride their nimble craft with perfect poise, whooping in exhilaration with every sharp banking turn and suicidally steep dive. Like airborne predators, the shoals of transports and gunships weave through incoming flak to encircle their prey and rain blistering fire upon them. Explosions leap skyward as enemy strongpoints and war engines are knocked out one after another. Next comes the ground assault, as murderous bands of Drukhari vault from their Raiders and Venoms to plunge into the reeling foe. Even as the bloodshed escalates amidst a whirlwind of whistling blades and cracking lashes, still the Drukhari skimmers streak back and forth to pick off targets of opportunity and rapidly relocate wild-eyed bands of gleeful Commorrite killers. Only once resistance has been utterly shattered do the grav-vessels halt, just long enough for captives and plunder to be heaped aboard their decks for the triumphant return to Commorragh.</p>||
000000934|DRU|Space Lane Raiders|<b>The Drukhari delight in launching piratical attacks on their victims’ voidships, gathering realspace raiding parties just as they would to assail an enemy world. Such close and nightmarish confines suit these raiding bands particularly well. Soon enough, the voidship rings to the screams of its defenders...</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000935|DRU|Kabalite Corsairs|<b>Every Drukhari Kabal is as much malevolent crime syndicate as it is private army, often with its own specialist areas of insidious expertise. Some Archons have a predilection for piratical boarding and raiding of voidships, their warbands honing their skills in these areas above all others.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000936|DRU|Ship-killer Cult|<b>Employing esoteric technologies to transmit their exploits back to debauched audiences in Commorragh, some Wych Cults board voidships as a kind of murderous death-sport. Here, the voidship becomes the arena, and the Wyches’ every violent action the entertainment for their baying fans.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000937|DRU|Painbringers|<b>The twisted fleshcrafters of the Haemonculus Covens seek to seize fresh captives for their laboratories. Boarding enemy vessels, they rely upon their menageries of mutant creations to smash through bulkheads and rip open hatches. The Haemonculi and their creations are empowered by pain both given and received, and will fight on through injuries that would spell doom for lesser beings.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000993|DRU|Reaper’s Wager|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The Reaper’s Wager is among the most macabre saedaths, depicting a gruesome tale of murderous bets between merciless killers and mythic executioners. It is a well-known tale that is greatly enjoyed in the depths of the Dark City. When Harlequin and Drukhari go to war as one, Commorrite warriors often perform an accompanying role in its retelling. Bladed Drukhari transports emerge from the Webway alongside scintillating Harlequin skimmers emblazoned with dazzling adornments. Kabalite Warriors open fire upon the foe from firing decks, and Wyches howl and whoop as they leap acrobatically into the fray. As Harlequin troupes begin their gore-slick recital, they inhabit their roles wholeheartedly, competing furiously with their Drukhari allies to score the greatest tally of luridly violent kills.</p>||
000000804|DRU|Realspace Raiders|<p class="ShowFluff legend">There are few better ways to display true power in Commorragh than by successfully allying warriors of the kabals, the wych cults and the haemonculus covens in a single raiding force. Only through cunning and flattery, menace and politicking is such a feat achieved. Yet the results achieved by forging such a temporary entente are rarely less than spectacular. Such tripartite realspace raids alloy the psychotraumatic sadism and nightmare weaponry of the covenites to the close-quarters quicksilver ferocity of the Wyches, underpinning the whole with the armoured firepower and paramilitary discipline of massed Kabalites. Augmented by bands of Commorrite sellswords with their esoteric combat specialities, the result is a raiding party as diverse as it is diabolical. Though they would never admit it, the strengths of each facet of Drukhari society cover for each others’ weaknesses, honing the blade of their martial might into something razor-swift and unutterably lethal.</p>||
000001113|DRU|Spectacle of Spite|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When a wych cult unleashes its full fury in a realspace raid, the bloody extravaganza of the arena is brought to the battlefield in spectacular style. Acrobatic gladiators dart into combat, wielding exotic tools of murder, each vying to score the most eye-catching kills. Jetbike-mounted Reavers scream low overhead, fairing blades lopping off their victims’ heads while cluster caltrops raise rippling detonations in their wake. Succubi - the uncontested stars of each frenzied performance - ride into battle aboard personal Venom chariots or stab, slash and weave their way through the melee, alabaster skin spattered with the vivid gore of their victims. Some wych cult raids are lent armoured support by their Kabalite patrons, the better to maximise carnage and ensure victory. Others are trailed by entire audiences of avid fans, Commorrites of every stripe who have come to enjoy the mayhem and feast on a banquet of pain. So involved do some spectators become that they rush in to join the fight alongside the Wyches and add their blades to the fray.</p>||
000001114|DRU|Covenite Coterie|<p class="ShowFluff legend">To face a realspace raid by the Haemonculi of the Dark City is to endure a living nightmare. Ghoulish things with worm-pale flesh and blades for fingers crawl and caper from the shadows, their blood-wet breath rasping eagerly through the slits of their iron masks. Engines of Pain drift through the air on whispering suspensors, loosing stinging blasts of firepower, gathering up screaming victims in nests of needle-tipped tendrils and flensing their flesh with snickering blades. Through it all move the Haemonculi, dealing out unspeakable agonies even as they leer with cruel gratification or hum to themselves with the distracted air of a scientist enjoying their labours. They are the composers of a gruesome flesh symphony, the conductors of an orchestra of despairing shrieks and gibbering glee fit to drive mortal minds to madness. Even those other Drukhari who fight alongside the covenites look askance at their twisted allies and count themselves lucky not to be on the receiving end of their insane attentions.</p>||
000001115|DRU|Kabalite Cartel|<p class="ShowFluff legend">No kabal can survive without the strength of arms to back up its demands and menaces. When the cream of that paramilitary strength is concentrated into a realspace raiding party and unleashed upon unsuspecting victims, the results are devastating. Reaving bands of Kabalites ride to war beneath the flayed-skin banners of their Archons. Each squad vies to outdo its rivals in cruelty and martial conquest, slaying and tormenting with spiteful abandon. At the same time, predatory gunships thrum overhead and bands of vicious mercenaries ply their bloody trade. Moreover, no two kabals are alike - each having its own portfolio of diabolical exploits and murderous predilections - and so each has its own particular agendas to pursue and strengths to bring to bear. One Kabalite raiding band might benefit from exceptionally well-crafted weaponry or a wealth of tailored toxins. Another might field swathes of terror troops, obsess overtaking bloody trophies, call upon the aid of arena gladiators or a myriad of other unique and murderous quirks.</p>||
000001033|EC|Mercurial Host|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The Emperor’s Children are a myriad of warbands driven by an obsessive desire to experience the thrill of battle in all its many forms. These warbands strike with a speed and excessive violence that is majestic in its ever-escalating cruelty. Tormentors and Infractors, their pupils dilated by exotic stimm cocktails, flesh scarred and sculpted by self-inflicted tortures, traverse the battlefield. Their murderous intentions flit from target to target, driven by their obsessive need for fresh experience and sensation. Each bloody kill they make is more excruciating and visually gratifying than the last. Noise Marines unleash wave after wave of discordant sonic destruction. The varied pitch and tone of blastmaster, sonic blaster and screamer pistol combine with the screams of the dying and the exultant battle cries of the Emperor’s Children to form a symphony of majestic horror.</p>||
000001034|EC|Peerless Bladesmen|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The Emperor’s Children are consumed by their own pride and driven by insatiable obsession. They seek to prove their prowess in myriad forms of combat. Tall and powerful Flawless Blades stride proudly into battle, seeking out enemy champions to gruesomely humble in single combat. They parry the blows of their foes with sneering arrogance and spill their blood with glee. In their blood-slick wake come squads of Infractors, empowered by rare and esoteric combat drugs. Other sons of Fulgrim unleash death in shredding salvoes from boltguns and sonic weapons. Those who exult in their swordfighting prowess find gaps in armour plate with their curved blades and sinuous whips, rending flesh and spilling viscera with each strike. The slaughter increases in pace and intensity as it rushes towards a gore-slick crescendo, ending only when the last wretched victim has been eviscerated, and the twisted souls of the Emperor’s Children are briefly glutted on the riotous carnage they have inflicted.</p>||
000001035|EC|Rapid Evisceration|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The armoured transports of the Emperor’s Children are a testament to the debased nature of those who ride within them. Daubed in vibrant colours and covered in symbols of dedication to both Legion and Dark Prince, the war engines’ twisted machine spirits snarl, whine and growl like beasts straining at the leash. Warp amps emit streams of daemonic screeches, spreading fear in the ranks of the enemy and heralding the slaughter to come. Laying down destructive choruses of firepower from turrets, hatches and sponsons, armoured transports grind over the foe’s defences, smash into enemy infantry and disgorge their fell cargo to battle. From the armoured behemoths emerge the Emperor’s Children, weapons drawn in anticipation of the glorious violence to come.</p>||
000001036|EC|Carnival of Excess|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Wherever the Emperor’s Children tread, wherever they indulge their every obsessive desire, wherever they gut, flay and slaughter, reality is torn asunder and through the veil pour the daemons of Slaanesh. Daemonettes leap forward, their lithe forms at once repulsive and alluring. Clouds of sickly soul-musk drift through the ranks of the foe dulling their senses whilst the susurrations of the advancing daemons lull the weak-willed into trances. Seekers of Slaanesh crash into their helpless victims, talon, claw and poisoned tongue ripping flesh asunder. Alongside their daemonic allies, the Emperor’s Children keep pace, letting out ecstatic laughter and booming battle cries as they unleash malefic sorceries and slaughter at will. Return fire finds only corrupted air as daemon and tainted warriors alike advance like a murderous pageant through the enemy fire with contemptuous ease.</p>||
000001037|EC|Coterie of the Conceited|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The Emperor’s Children possess a desire for perfection and superiority that drives them to inflict ever greater and more impressive death upon their foes. To satisfy their urges, some Emperor’s Children warlords strike desperate pacts with daemonic powers. By doing so they wager their souls and those of their warriors and in turn promise to outdo their rivals in the volume and luridity of carnage they inflict. In return, they may be granted power beyond measure, and the ability to experience limitless sensation. Those who have sworn such pacts urge their warriors forward and hurl themselves into battle with desperation and exhilaration. Each torture inflicted and each gory kill brings them one step closer to fulfilling their part of the bargain. Failure, however, can lead only to a violent death or, far worse, the ire of their patron and the torturous obliteration of their very soul.</p>||
000001038|EC|Slaanesh’s Chosen|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Amongst the Emperor’s Children are those who see themselves as particularly favoured by Slaanesh. These puissant champions of excess have inflicted deaths beyond count, suffered agonies beyond measure and won glorious victories in honour of the Dark Prince. When such champions of ruin gather together, they are driven to outdo one another. Whether engaging enemy commanders in brutal duels, inflicting exquisite agonies upon mewling mortals or offering sacrifices to their unholy deity, the chosen of Slaanesh are unceasing in their murderous advance. To these paragons of arrogance and superiority, no foe is worthy of respect, and few are capable of providing the challenge they desire. Thus, their rivalries are with their own, each vying for Slaanesh’s attention. Only those who prove themselves the deadliest will gain the approval they seek.</p>||

000000941|GC|Infestation Swarm|<b>Many doomed voidships have been infested by Genestealers, their corridors and crawlways transformed into the hunting grounds and brood-lairs of monstrous vanguard organisms.

000001002|GC|Final Day|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Every Genestealer Cultist wishes to witness the Star Children’s arrival and ascend to join them in blessed oneness. They believe this will be a transcendent experience, a sublime reward for their devotion. The reality is altogether more hideous. As the Tyranids approach through the void, the utterly alien Hive Mind assimilates the more nuanced Broodmind of the cult. Many faithful die from psionic shock. Others are freed from Tyranid mind control only to go mad with horror as the truth is revealed. The rest become short-lived puppets for the first waves of Tyranid vanguard organisms descending on their world. Exerting its will to make them fight harder and move faster, the Hive Mind swiftly burns out these surviving faithful, harvesting each flicker of bioenergy to reinvigorate its more valuable Tyranid organisms.</p>||
000000943|GK|Void Purge Force|<b>Whether striking into a warp-compromised vessel to annihilate all aboard, defending a vital Grey Knights warship from infernal threats, or removing allies or foes who know too much, these strike teams of Grey Knights hit hard and fast to ensure none escape their purge.</b>|Boarding Actions|

000000992|GK|Warpbane Task Force|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When daemonic entities corrupt the worlds of the Imperium, Grey Knights forces strike to cleanse unhallowed ground and restore the sanctity of the Emperor’s domain. Such formations are raised when only the most obscure and esoteric rituals of purgation will drive the taint of Chaos back into the depths of the Warp. Striding fearlessly into malignant hellscapes, the warriors of the Order of Purifiers lead the assault. The combined psychic might of these anointed champions manifests in an azure fire that ignites the bodies and souls of unclean foes and scours away the taint of witchcraft and infernal corruption. In place of this excised perversion, an ensorcelled zone of consecration is created, within which the Grey Knights are emboldened and empowered.</p>||
000001081|GK|Brotherhood Strike|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When supernatural terrors endanger the very survival of Humanity, strike forces assembled from the might of the Grey Knights brotherhoods deploy to end the threat. Forewarned by the scrying of the Prognosticars, these hosts bring a balance of infantry and armour assets best suited to completing their mission, allied by the mightiest war leaders the Chapter can muster. No weapon or relic of esoteric technology is forbidden to such strike forces. In particular, these warriors wield the potent sorceries of Titan, not only to blast their enemies with excoriating energies but also to rapidly traverse battlefields through coruscating Warp gates. By employing such arcane tactics, the Grey Knights can rapidly outmanoeuvre even the most well-entrenched or fast-moving foes and focus the full wrath of their brotherhood precisely where it is most needed. Heretical rituals are cast into ruin, daemonic demagogues exorcised and slain, and the mightiest foes of the Imperium are purged without mercy by these warrior hosts.</p>||
000001082|GK|Hallowed Conclave|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The indomitable core of the Grey Knights’ fighting forces are their Terminator-armoured battle-brothers. When enough of these heavily equipped combatants gather, their amassed strength and resilience are a match for hosts of enemies many times their number. Incoming fire rattles from blessed and warded Terminator plate while hostile sorcery dwindles to nothing before the Grey Knights’ combined Aegis. In return, the hulking templars of Titan maintain unceasing firepower and banishing magicks that winnow the enemy’s ranks before their inevitable and overwhelming charge crashes home. Though surrounded by screaming foes, the Grey Knights hack a relentless path ever deeper with their Nemesis blades and hammers singing in their fists. Unstoppable, indefatigable, the Terminators press forward to shatter diabolical rites, seal diabolical Warp gates, slay possessed tyrants and carve the will of the Emperor into the flesh of their foes.</p>||
000001083|GK|Banishers|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The esoteric arsenal of the Grey Knights is as potent as their armoury of more conventional munitions. Indeed, when the most corrupt or supernatural foes must be defeated, these arcane weapons may prove more powerful than any volume of bolt shells and blades. By bringing together their mightiest psychic warriors and focusing the empyric powers they have learned to wield as no others could, the Grey Knights harness the terrifying might of the Warp without succumbing to its insidious taint. The result is a strike force of warriors wreathed in unnatural flame and shielded by potent warding sigils that whirl about them like an arcane constellation. The air shudders with psychic overpressure as the Grey Knights advance, vox-amplified voices raised in chants of banishment and malediction that ring above the thunder of their guns and the crackle of their blades. Warp-spawned entities are blasted into ectoplasmic slicks before their advance, while more corporeal foes fall as swiftly before the psychic might of Titan made manifest.</p>||
000001084|GK|Sanctic Spearhead|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Many Grey Knights task forces are supported by assets drawn from the Chapter’s Armoury, be it ward-inscribed armoured transports, ancient Dreadnought battle-brothers, swift Stormraven Gunships or towering Nemesis Dreadknights piloted by the Chapter’s greatest warriors. Yet there are threats and foes so monstrous that they must be countered with a mass host of these sanctified engines of war. At such times, the ground shudders beneath pounding adamantine feet, and the grinding tracks of the mightiest battle tanks to roll from the Deimosian forges. Entire flights of silver-grey gunships streak overhead, their holds packed with psychic battle-brothers, their wings guarded by nimble fighter craft. Combat walkers stride from teleport flares just as the rest of their armoured onslaught hits the enemy lines like a thunderbolt, leaving nothing but devastation in their wake. In this way, the Grey Knights shatter the mightiest enemy armies or break through to critical locations in time to stave off calamity.</p>||
000001085|GK|Augurium Task Force|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Empyric scrying, ancient prophecies of cataclysmic events, Warp-sent visions experienced by the Chapter’s most potent psykers: by such esoteric means are the Grey Knights sometimes forewarned of where, when and how a threat will arise in far more detail even than is usual. Such omens are never squandered. When allowed to truly prepare, the warriors of Titan ensure they are positioned to prevent the rising peril rapidly. Battles of this sort see the Grey Knights remaining ahead of their enemies as they employ their foreknowledge to anticipate and outmanoeuvre the foe’s every strike. Bands of steely-eyed battle-brothers step from blazing teleport flares to gun down flanking forces. Champions of Titan intervene at pivotal moments to send summoning rituals awry or bring supernatural portals crashing down in ruin. Locking blades with fate itself, the Grey Knights hack and parry, stab and slice until they have carved the future into a new and bloody form that benefits the Imperium.</p>||
000000950|LoV|Void Salvagers|<b>The salvage fleets of the Leagues of Votann secure material resources and recover stolen technologies. Their aggressive salvage operations bring them into conflict with hostile foes. It is fortunate, therefore, that Kin soldiers are well suited to combat in the close confines of space hulks and voidships.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000951|LoV|Hearthfire Strike|<b>During the most punishing void battles, when the butcher’s bill is spiralling but the promised rewards still justify the cost of conflict, the most expedient plan is often also the most direct. Gathering the might of the Einhyr, the Kin launch a single, thunderous strike to end all enemy resistance.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000001001|LoV|Hearthband|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When the Eye of the Ancestors has been cast and the worth of some site or resource deemed vital, the Kin may form a hearthband to ensure its swift conquest. Typically led by one or more of the kindred’s most courageous and strategically cunning Kâhls, such forces are painstakingly forged to complete the precise mission for which they are assembled. Einhyr elites lead the charge, exo-armoured forms advancing like the Ancestors come to life, contemptuous of the enemy’s pitiful attempts to cut them down with gunfire or stagger their charge. Hand-picked Hearthkyn support their advance, no mere citizen soldiers but instead the finest warriors of the kinhost assembled for this one crucial mission. Driving inexorably into the teeth of the foe, the hearthband does not stop until their task is complete and the battle is won.</p>||
000001096|LoV|Needgaârd Oathband|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When a valuable site is identified, the Kin waste no time amassing an expeditionary force to secure and hold the prize. Needgaârd oathbands are typically forged around a core of Hearthkyn Warriors, readied to loose their weapons. Backed up by formidable armoured support, guild affiliates, and bands of elite warriors, such gatherings of the kinhost’s might overwhelm local defences and swiftly entrench their control. Commanders of these oathbands are experts in efficiently exploiting every martial advantage. Enemy reinforcements break upon fortified Kin positions and are then pulverised by systematic volleys of fire before they can escape to lend support elsewhere. The foe’s vanguard are outmanoeuvred and eradicated, their destruction opening up avenues of advance. Kin battle tanks and magna-coil gunships hammer armoured columns into a standstill and corral the enemy, with the remaining forces disintegrating by the time the oathband’s close-assault troops deliver the final blow.</p>||
000001097|LoV|Persecution Prospect|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Even sedentary kindreds have a long reach, for their Hernkyn are mobile and pernicious. Persecution prospects are far-ranging military forces built around a core of Hernkyn and capable of seizing their Kindred’s industrial interests, no matter what claims the foe believes they have. These forces engage in destabilisation strikes, sabotage and resource denial. They specialise in bleeding a foe of impetus through repeated attacks from multiple angles with coordination born of efficient tactics and close-knit familial bonds. Bands of callous Yaegirs operate in advance of the prospect’s attack, spreading discord and fear through strongpoint attacks and assassinations while passing targeting data to supporting Kin. Squadrons of Pioneers make flanking attacks, weakening enemy positions to leave them vulnerable to assaults by Hearthkyn and Einhyr. For every step the foe takes, they are assailed from every angle until any survivors are driven off in disarray, enabling the Kin to seize their rightful prize.</p>||
000001098|LoV|Dêlve Assault Shift|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Many are the species who, to their cost, have failed to consider the full battlesphere capabilities of the Kin. The Cthonian guilds, in particular, have long mastered exploiting what they term the delve. In some situations, this is a network of subterranean passages, cunningly wrought with hidden surface access ways to permit rapid combat relocation of their ferocious cyberaltered Beserks. In others, particularly during Cthonian assaults upon giant void freighters or mountainous hives, the guilds employ Colossus-class macrobore engines to deliver troops from every angle or specialist teleport assaults that simultaneously undermine a foe’s positions and deliver infantry into their midst. The assault shift’s mole mortars unleash tunnelling salvoes of esoteric ammunition to fracture defensive emplacements such that armoured support and augmented Beserks can smash their way through. Multilayered weavewerke fields, meanwhile, buttress the Kin’s assault routes that delve unerringly into the foe’s heart.</p>||
000001099|LoV|Brandfast Oathband|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Like a red-hot mass hammer repeatedly searing its mark into the hardest of materials, the blows of a brandfast oathband pummel a war zone and imprint it with an undeniable sign of the Kin’s claim. Such forces are typically mechanised, boasting rugged transports to speed a kinhost’s warriors into strategically advantageous positions. The foe’s infantry are driven back by supporting artillery and squads of Thunderkyn, whilst Kapricus and Sagitaurs employ evasive speed to outmanoeuvre enemy attempts to stall their advance. These smaller transports swiftly establish themselves as frontier outposts, their cargoes of Hearthkyn and Yaegirs using the vehicles’ heavy armour as cover while the transports’ powerful weapons carve through light opposition and relay tactical data to the squads. Hekaton Land Fortresses grind forward in their wake, bulldozing their way to the fore like mobile bastions. What began as a contested war zone is swiftly turned into a Kin holding with bulwarks and defensive embrasures the equal of a fortified city of other species.</p>||
000001100|LoV|Hearthfyre Arsenal|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The potent volume of advanced firepower most Kin forces can unleash is enough to drive back would-be rivals from a kindred’s rightful claims. Yet it pales before the might of a hearthfyre arsenal, which gathers many of a kindred’s experts on ordnance application into a single, deadly force. They alloy the Kin’s ballistic superiority, inventive experimentation and masterwork engineering, and the ruthless logistical calculation required to dismantle the enemy efficiently, one piece at a time. Iron-masters and Thunderkyn unleash the Brokhyr guilds’ forge-wrought power in salvoes of high-explosive bolts, esoteric graviton emissions and energistic conversion beams. Phalanxes of Ironkin Steeljacks smash into reeling enemies like a steel gauntlet, their assaults’ timing forecast by Memnyr Strategists to result in the greatest ruin. Every ounce of advantage is analysed, and every weakness of their opponents is calculated until the foe’s expected capitulation becomes just another dispassionate forecast.</p>||

000000985|NEC|Starshatter Arsenal|<p class="ShowFluff legend">A wide range of mechanical treasures are stored within the grand armouries of the Necron dynasties. Some Necron nobles prefer to wage mobile warfare, utilising the swiftest of these vehicles, including imperious anti-grav war barques, looming mechanical walkers and supersonic assault craft powered by eldritch technologies to outflank, outrun and eliminate their enemies. As the armoured tide sweeps over the hopelessly outmatched foe, Ghost Arks swoop low to disgorge rank upon rank of skeletal Necron Warriors. Other forms of servile construct and maniacal killing machines join the lethal procession, too, adding their firepower to the cosmic wrath, and when the foe inevitably breaks, dynastic soldiery piloting – or fused with – repulsor-driven platforms surge forwards to scythe down any who would attempt to flee.</p>||

000000995|ORK|Taktikal Brigade|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The Orks who belong to the Blood Axe clan seek to apply their own brand of taktiks to their endless wars.

000000988|QI|Questor Forgepact|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Bound by oaths of fealty or not, many Knightly houses enjoy close relations with the priesthood of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Whether answering the Martian priesthood’s calls to arms or prosecuting their own wars of liberation against the Emperor’s foes, Noble families regularly pilot their war suits to battle alongside their Tech-Priest allies. The Skitarii soldiery are inspired by the presence of these ancient engines of destruction, uttering awestruck psalms of veneration as they advance fearlessly towards the foe. In turn, the Noble champions are blessed and inspired by the chanted prayers of the Machine Cult and their war suits empowered by the skill of Tech-Priests and artificers of incomparable talent.</p>||
000001106|QI|Valourstrike Lance|<p class="ShowFluff legend">To crusade as part of a lance of Knightly companions is to be inspired to heights of noble heroism and feel the surge of honour that flows through the Throne Mechanicum. Valourstrike Lances epitomise the bold gallantry of Imperial Knights and the unbreakable fellowship that binds them. Their Noble warriors and loyal squires thunder into battle like an iron-shod storm. Barrages of unremitting firepower herald their assault, bolts of energy and clusters of heavy ordnance lancing out to punish the dishonourable foe. The Knights do not slow for a moment; their enemy deserves no such sufferance. The speed of their long strides carries the Noble companions into the foes’ holdouts. With the monumental power at their command, valorous groups of Knights lay waste to one swathe of enemies after another. Theirs is a selfless strength that shields and inspires their fellow Knights. It is a thunderous power that sees them punch through defensive lines, artillery emplacements and desperate counterstrikes by the foe until nothing but ruin is left in their wake.</p>||
000001107|QI|Gate Warden Lance|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The forebears of Knightly Nobles secured their sprawling citadels through Old Night and whispered advice from those times still haunts the oldest Thrones Mechanicum. For generations since, Gate Warden Lances of Knights have thrown back xenos, heretics and mutants not only from their own walls but from those on worlds across the galaxy. Whether a physical revetment exists to guard or not, the Nobles know their duty. They treat the battlefield as their walled realm, with themselves as its bastions. Gigantic Dominus-class Knights anchor defensive positions, hurling murderous salvoes at encroaching enemies. Bondsmen piloting swift Armigers stand ready to lope forwards and stem encirclements of the Knights’ lines. Knights Crusader scythe down infantry besieging their chosen embrasures while Knights Defender stride into line to bolster positions with thrumming void shields. Should the enemy attempt to breach the Knights’ lines, the Nobles sally forth in a thunderous countercharge, challenges blaring from war horns as they dam the tide.</p>||
000001108|QI|Questoris Companions|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The legendary deeds of groups of Knightly champions are known across the Imperium. Epic lays have been inspired by crusading lances of a household’s greatest warriors, isolated bands of Knights who have fought their way to victory and honoured fellowships of Freeblades oathed to fight in chivalrous companionship until death claims them. Bonded by vows of honour, these Questoris Companions marshal their strength, their courage and the incredible power of their titanic Knight suits to undertake heroic feats of epic gallantry to achieve their quest. Individual Knights hold back armoured columns in glorious acts of selflessness to guard their companions’ flanks. Others wade alone into overwhelming odds, slamming enemy battle tanks through the air and crushing infantry underfoot. The most threatening of the foe are singled out for thunderous duels, and their humbling is a terrifying blow to enemy morale. With a rigid notion of their quest’s righteousness, the companions drive onwards in a ferocious display of titanic might.</p>||
000001109|QI|Spearhead-At-Arms|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When deployed in large numbers, the swift and agile Armiger-class Knight suits can outmanoeuvre most foes. They strike and withdraw on simultaneous fronts to cut apart more unwieldy armies. Deployed as a Spearhead-at-Arms, meanwhile, and leashed to their Noble masters’ stern wisdom, their loyal conditioning and rapid adoption of complex strategies enable them to eviscerate any enemy. With loping strides, the lead Armigers fan out as a swift vanguard. They devastate enemy scouts and flush war engines into the sights of their lords and ladies. Banners of Armiger Helverins stalk into firing positions like towering assassins, spitting death into assigned targets of heavy infantry or snatching grav-tanks from the sky in blazing fireballs. Armiger Warglaives pounce on enemy fire points or ambush enemy assault formations, their reaper chain-cleavers howling as they chew through armour. They are their masters’ hounds, shield-bearers and heavily armed retainers in one, galvanised into deadly coordination through honoured service.</p>||
000000806|QT|Traitoris Lance|<p class="ShowFluff legend">To fight amidst a Traitoris Lance is to epitomise what it means to be a Chaos Knight. Here is the dark mirror of nobility wrought in adamantine and steel, an army of sinister war giants driven ever onward by hate, cruelty and the tyrannical need to crush all beneath their mighty tread. Nightmarish storm clouds spread above these Chaos Knights as they stride into battle, drowning their quailing foes in creeping shadow and filling their hearts with dread. Empyric lightning leaps through the heavens, while the grotesque avian entities known as Pterrorshades swoop above the advancing Knights like tattered rags or roost malevolently upon their baroque hulls. As the Traitoris Lance bears down upon its victims, the Fallen Nobles lengthen their steeds’ strides and let fly with massive cannons, laser blasters and racks of shrieking missiles. By the time their charge thunders home, the crumbling enemy lines can do naught but shatter before the unstoppable onslaught of these diabolical engines of war.</p>||
000000989|QT|Iconoclast Fiefdom|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When the Fallen Nobles of Iconoclast houses go to war, they are often followed by teeming masses of mutants, cultists, and heretic soldiers. These awed mortals offer chanted prayers to these towering beacons of corruption, worshipping them as mechanical idols to the Dark Gods. Rushing forward around the clawed feet of these gigantic Knight suits, the cursed hordes scream battle cries and sing of their devotion as they hurl themselves into the foe. As the death count beneath them escalates, the Fallen Nobles rejoice in the bloodshed, the Warp-twisted mechanisms of their Thrones Mechanicum feeding vampirically upon the sacrifice of their thralls and infusing pilot and steed with ever-greater infernal might.</p>||
000001075|QT|Infernal Lance|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Whether sworn to a Traitor Titan Legion, in thrall to the cyborg priests of the Dark Mechanicum, pledged to the Ruinous Powers or corrupted over millennia, the Knights of Infernal Lances are twisted by the warp and swollen with unholy technologies. Each Knight suit is a hideous blend of the mechanical and the supernatural. Some bear the blessings of a Dark God of Chaos, which renders them freakish with mutation yet enhances their might or resilience in battle. Others mount weapon systems of ancient or diabolical provenance, serve as the possessed metal body of a malevolent daemon or exhibit strange abilities conferred by the experimentations of dark magi. When such monstrous war engines stalk into battle behind the banner of one strong-willed enough to master them, the Infernal Lances they form sweep aside any foe. Those not obliterated or reduced to gruesome spawn by the Knights’ warp-tainted weapons are driven mad and sent fleeing in mindless terror by the horrors they witness.</p>||
000001076|QT|Lords of Dread|<p class="ShowFluff legend">None are safe when the long shadows of the Lords of Dread stretch across the battlefield. Some Fallen Nobles are so toweringly arrogant, so twisted in mind and soul or so enamoured of personal power and wealth that they fight only for themselves. Those not slain by jealous rivals or laid low by foes instead earn notoriety and become the dark heroes in their tales of legend. They earn supernatural boons for their mightiest deeds. They recover ancient and devastating artefacts of war or gather coteries of followers who trail in their wake and hope for reflected glory. Such lords amongst the Chaos Knights may seek one another out and fight side by side. Some do this to test their mettle and prove themselves the greatest. Others find twisted kinship in the company of other Fallen Nobles as egocentric as themselves, forming Dreadblade lances or staging a hostile takeover of a dread household before supplanting its original rulers with a new and especially tyrannical court of monsters.</p>||
000001077|QT|Houndpack Lance|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Swift, comparatively numerous, yet each still a towering war engine in its own right, when War Dogs gather for the hunt they bring terrifying might to bear. Sometimes this power is leashed to the mental domination of masters piloting Abhorrent-class Knights. Such formations lope out like some feudal world hunting party, the larger Knights inhabiting the roles of bloodthirsty nobles while the War Dogs serve as their baying hounds. Other dread households prefer to give their War Dogs more freedom. They dispatch formations of these light and fast Knight suits into the wilds of the war zone to raid and cause mayhem at will, choking off supply lines and tearing apart targets of opportunity until the foe fears to leave their strongholds. Then there are the Unleashed. These masterless packs of War Dogs have broken their former masters’ control and now hunt and slaughter in pursuit of their own glories. Over time, these packs become ever more feral, following the direction of their alphas and dragging down prey like murderous super-predators.</p>||

000000981|SM|Lion’s Blade Task Force|<p class="ShowFluff legend">There is no more significant duty to the Dark Angels’ Inner Circle than the pursuit and capture of the Fallen. A Lion’s Blade Task Force combines the speed, manoeuvrability and firepower of the Ravenwing with the obdurate might of the Deathwing. The bikes, aircraft and speeders of the Ravenwing thunder across the battlefield, smashing through enemy formations to place teleport homers in key positions behind the enemy lines. Then come the Deathwing, appearing in crackling flashes of blue light to enact retribution with brutal efficiency.</p>||
000000994|SM|Librarius Conclave|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The Space Marine psykers that comprise the ranks of the Librarius often stand apart from their battle-brothers, many of whom find their mastery of occult powers disturbing. Yet, despite their misgivings, no Space Marine doubts the might of their Chapter’s Librarians. On rare occasions, often in response to daemonic invasion or the machinations of xenos psykers, a group of Librarians may accompany a hand-picked task force to war. When leading squads of transhuman warriors into the fight, such a conclave may enhance their battle-brothers’ already supreme strength, speed and endurance with channelled empyric energies, confound their enemies with illusory deceptions, or obliterate the foe in blazing torrents of flame.</p>||
000001004|SM|Angelic Inheritors|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The Blood Angels have inherited much from their Primarch. Their grace, nobility and psychic prowess all trace back to Sanguinius, as does the spiritual curse that has afflicted them since his death. More esoteric, perhaps, but no less a bequest of their gene-sire is the Blood Angels’ propensity to blaze brightest during the darkest moments of despair. Just as Sanguinius himself is said to have brought hope to the hopeless at the point of his gilded spear, so too do the Blood Angels rise in the face of adversity as though in fulfilment of some ancient prophecy. At such times, the angelic and monstrous natures ever at war within Sanguinius’ gene-sons find an equilibrium. Icy calm in their ferocity, furious in their clarity, the warrior angels of Baal strike with unerring and unstoppable wrath to snatch victory from the bloodied jaws of defeat.</p>||
000001006|SM|Wrathful Procession|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The Black Templars excel at heavy infantry shock assaults. These talents prove especially effective when fighting battles where armoured support is limited, or the terrain is too dense to deploy heavier assets. Whether taking an enemy facility corridor by corridor, storming the breach in a siege, or digging heretics out of thick jungle or ruins, the Black Templars are well suited. Before such engagements, their leaders fire the battle-brothers’ fanaticism with hate-fuelled oratory and vox-amplified prayer to heights beyond even the fervour usually displayed by this Chapter. As one, the Black Templars begin their advance, banners to the fore, a holy procession swiftly gathering pace from stride to lope to thunderous headlong charge that caves in the enemy lines like a ceramite-clad fist driven into a heretic’s face.</p>||
000001008|SM|Champions of Fenris|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The Champions of Fenris give vent to blood-chilling howls as they storm into battle. They are the hand-picked warriors of Great Wolf Logan Grimnar, the exemplars of all that it means to be a Space Wolf, and every last one of them fights to prove themselves worthy of such accolades. Even should they do battle without their lord at their head, still they strive as though he was watching and judging their every effort. They commit one saga-worthy deed after another. They hunt down and lay low the mightiest prey. They conquer seemingly impossible odds, employing their veteran skill and cunning to its fullest extent and winning victories worthy of celebration in feast and song. On worlds across the galaxy, no matter how terrible the foe or deadly the battlefield, the champions of Fenris fight endlessly in defence of the Allfather’s realm.</p>||
000001059|SM|Wrath of the Rock|||
000001068|SM|Saga of the Hunter|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When the Great Companies go to war, they descend upon their foes with lightning speed, relying upon shock assaults to overwhelm even the most robust defences. Blood Claws smash into weak points whilst Grey Hunters outflank and strike the already-engaged foe. Long Fangs catch armoured vehicles and heavy infantry in punishing crossfires, and Wolf Scouts infiltrate enemy positions to sabotage prepared strongholds. By concentrating their firepower and force upon critical targets, the Space Wolves maximise the effectiveness of their savage assault. Utilising this ruthless precision, lupine cunning and unwavering stamina, the Space Wolves can pick apart numerically superior foes in much the same manner as Fenrisian wolves hunt the giant prey of the Space Wolves’ icy home. The greatest of the Chapter’s sagas tell of such battles and the myriad foes brought low by closely bonded packs of warriors.</p>||
000001069|SM|Saga of the Bold|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The grand feasting halls of Fenris echo with the sagas of the Chapter’s greatest heroes. Every son of Russ hopes one day to forge his own tale of heroism and glory and take his place in the annals of the Great Companies. Thus, the Space Wolves armies are replete with many great champions, each of whom has felled foes beyond count and earned a deed name to match. When such heroes go to war, they lead their battle-brothers by example, hurling themselves into combat with furious aggression and inspirational acts of savagery. Bellowing oaths and making outlandish boasts, these champions seek to outdo one another. Encouraged forward in the wake of such heroic figures, Blood Claws and Grey Hunters battle alongside their Wolf Lord’s mighty Wolf Guard, fighting with resilience and vigour regardless of the odds arrayed against them.</p>||
000001070|SM|Saga of the Beastslayer|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Many terrible beasts stalk Fenris’ tundra or dwell within the depths of its frothing seas, and its people possess many tales of the slaying of such terrors. Some who ascend to the ranks of the Space Wolves continue this tradition of monster slaying, seeking out the largest, strongest and most lethal foes and pitting their strength against them. Bellowing battle cries, Thunderwolf Cavalry form wedges and charge, cutting through enemy infantry to reach such worthy prey. Wolves bound forward at their side, falling upon the wounded with feral hunger. Frenzied Wulfen, their bodies afflicted by the ravages of the Canis Helix, crash into armoured formations to swing thunder hammers and bring to bear crackling lightning claws. Then come the Wolf Guard, clad in Terminator armour or equipped as Headtakers, exploiting breaches in the enemy line to close upon their chosen prey. With each mighty warrior slain or titanic behemoth felled, the cohesion of the foe erodes and victory is brought closer to fruition.</p>||
000001086|SM|Forgefather’s Seekers|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The Forgefathers of the Salamanders have quested for millennia to find their Primarch’s scattered relics. The incumbent Seeker, Vulkan He’stan, will stop at nothing to see his task done. The battle-brothers who fight at their side are masters of short-ranged firefights and close-quarters engagements. These warriors stride into the midst of their foes, immolating them in tempests of flame or blasting them apart with volleys of bolter fire. Only once the enemy have been reduced to ashes does the Forgefather’s search truly begin.</p>||
000001091|SM|Companions of Vehemence|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The most zealous hosts of the Black Templars kindle their hatred of the God-Emperor’s foes until it is a raging inferno; this visceral enmity is used by Companions of Vehemence to fuel violent surges into the enemy lines. These strike forces are spurred on by the ferocious battle litanies of Chaplains and inspired by the bloody deeds of Judiciars. Vox-augmented sermons of detestation resound across the battlefield, followed by the catechistic crackles of disruption fields, the angry buzz of chainswords and the screams of the cursed. The renowned speed and brutality of the Adeptus Astartes are infused with the crusaders’ zealotry. They race from one living enemy to the next alongside battle tanks that crush the fallen beneath bloodied tracks. Supporting squads, meanwhile, unleash thunderous volleys at close range, eager to rush into the fray should anything escape their fusillades. Those enemies who flee merely prolong their terror, for the Black Templars are aspects of the God-Emperor’s inescapable judgement made manifest.</p>||
000001092|SM|Vindication Task Force|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Sacred standards and consecrated banners in great numbers anoint the consecrated battlegrounds of Vindication Task Forces. These brotherhoods stamp the God-Emperor’s undeniable authority wherever they strike. Cleaving to the purity of their mission with the stubborn tenacity of Dorn, the Black Templars ruthlessly extinguish their foe from holy sites and bludgeon any attempts to retake them. Veteran Ancients brandish the icons and heraldries of the crusade in pious defiance, the standards’ radiance declaring the God-Emperor’s sovereignty, and each a challenge to his enemies. In sight of them, the holdouts of heretics are revealed and put to righteous flame. Sorcerous corruption is wiped clean in barrages of scripture-incised missiles, while xenos forts are torn down by the pilots of hulking warsuits and revered Dreadnoughts. Inspired by the honour of iconic reliquaries, millennia-old shrouds and hallowed tapestries, the Black Templars reclaim and reconsecrate the Emperor’s domain with blood.</p>||
000001093|SM|Godhammer Assault Force|<p class="ShowFluff legend">An armoured assault by the Black Templars has been likened to the holy spears of devastation unleashed by lascannons of the venerable Land Raider. Godhammer Assault Forces are mechanised spearheads built around a core of heavily armoured transports. Mobile artillery keep pace with their advance, suppressing desperate attempts to stall the crusaders. Assault tanks crack open enemy fortifications. Squadrons of attack craft and bikers scythe down attempts to outflank the wedge of sanctified adamantine while dropships scar the skies with blazing contrail brands. By the time the mailed fist strikes, the foe are already reeling. Land Raiders, Rhinos and Repulsors shielded by blessed armour scatter fleeing soldiers and smash through obstructions. As the pugnacious transports’ assault ramps slam down, built-in vox-emitters blare the battle oaths of the Black Templars, and the crusade’s elite are disgorged into the foe’s vulnerable heart. Where a Godhammer Assault Force strikes, little is left but rubble and ruin.</p>||
000001103|SM|Emperor’s Shield|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Comprising the Chapter’s most elite veterans, the Imperial Fists 1st Company – known as the Emperor’s Shield – are an indomitable fighting force. Led by First Captain Lysander, the battle-brothers of the 1st favour the application of overwhelming force, striking always where the enemy is strongest, picking out priority targets and shattering them in coordinated assaults. Vanguard Veterans charge into the fray, tearing at exposed flanks and forcing gaps in the enemy line. Meanwhile, the Chapter’s Sternguard stride forward to exploit these breaches and seize ground. Lysander and his Terminator bodyguard are always at the centre of the fighting, inserted by Land Raider or orbital teleportarium to rip out the heart of the enemy in stunning and precisely targeted displays of martial might.</p>||
000001104|SM|Shadowmark Talon|<p class="ShowFluff legend">As Chapter Master of the Raven Guard, Aethon Shaan is a true master of the Trifold Path, utilising ambush, stealth and vigilance with surgical precision. Following his well-laid plans, Scout Squads, Infiltrators and other clandestine warriors penetrate the enemy line to wage guerrilla warfare. As these battle-brothers draw the attention of the foe, the remainder of Shaan’s warriors close in for the kill, assassinating officers and bringing down war machines with bursts of pinpoint fire. Before the enemy can react the Raven Guard are on the move once more, slipping into the shadows in preparation for the next targeted attack. Then, when the foe is bloodied and reeling, Shaan launches the main thrust of his assault, sweeping down with jump troops at his side to eviscerate his wounded prey.</p>||
000001118|SM|Hammer of Avernii|<p class="ShowFluff legend">The most veteran warriors of the Iron Hands Chapter, Clan Company Avernii are as merciless as they are unstoppable in battle. Marching relentlessly into the teeth of the foe, grim-faced Terminators and heavily augmented Sternguard Veterans sweep the enemy lines with targeting cogitators before eliminating their victims with unmerciful precision. Vanguard and Bladeguard Veterans tap into the volcanic ferocity that always boils – tightly contained – within the hearts of every Iron Hand, launching piledriver assaults into the heart of the enemy lines and slaughtering everything in reach. In the centre of the carnage is Caanok Var himself. He is the ironwrought cogitator that directs the flow of battle, the thundering reactor that fires the ire of his battle-brothers and the piston-driven bludgeon that reduces the foe to bloodied ruin.</p>||
000001119|SM|Spearpoint Task Force|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When Suboden Khan rides to war, he is accompanied by the cream of the Chapter. Some go to war mounted on Raider-pattern bikes, forming the lance tip by which the enemy line is broken. Stormspeeders skim overhead, harassing the enemy with fire, whilst elite infantry scramble from their transports to exploit the salients their mounted brothers have opened. The First Khan orchestrates these assaults and sweeping flanking manoeuvres from the saddle of his grav bike. He leads from the front, raking the enemy with fire before plunging into their ranks.</p>||
000001120|SM|Blade of Ultramar|<p class="ShowFluff legend">No Chapter better embodies the Codex Astartes’ teachings than the Ultramarines, and no officer amongst their ranks more perfectly employs those lessons than Marneus Calgar. Under the deft command of the Chapter Master, squads of Ultramarines alloy their battlefield roles of veteran, battle line, close support and fire support, becoming a relentless machine of destruction. From squad-level tactics up to their sweeping battlefield strategy, Calgar’s warriors fight as though they were already privy to the foe’s plans and have adapted a countermeasure for every last cut and thrust. Orchestrated with the Chapter Master’s flowing strategic genius, the plan unfolds like multi-layered, adaptive clockwork until the last of the enemy are naught but bodies and wreckage to be crushed beneath Calgar’s armoured boots. </p>||

In the case of Auxiliary Cadres, however, the doctrine of unity is realised on a grand scale. These forces comprise a majority of alien auxiliaries, fighting alongside limited numbers of T’au specialists and heavy combat assets and provided with overall T’au strategic command. Such integrated cadres provide versatile response forces to plug gaps in Fire caste lines of battle, blunt enemy aggression in dense terrain, and selflessly act as lures in grand Kauyon ambushes to spare valuable T’au lives.</p>||

They seek to shatter the veil between reality and the Warp, empowering their arcane arts and unleashing daemonic energies upon their weak-minded foes. Directing their mindless Rubricae to seize sites of power, these Sorcerers tap into the wellspring of potential power, weaving obscuring rituals and killing spells. As the tide of arcane energy builds in strength, the battlefield comes alive with mutagenic Warp energy, enhancing the Sorcerers’ magical power and haloing their thralls in fulminating coronae of uncontrolled arcane force. With warpflame and hellfire, they sweep the enemy from the field of battle, and Tzeentch claims the souls of the dead.</p>||

Such occult gatherings of the Cyclops’ psychic scions, bestial prophets and daemonic mages draw empyric power to them in writhing thunderheads. Coruscating wychfire leaps in crackling fingers from their outstretched staves and surges in multicoloured sheets from their gauntlets. Entrenched infantry are incinerated in vivid flame and prismatic beams core enemy battle tanks. Under the light of strange illusions, flesh and metal twist into insane new forms. Statuesque automata and the cursed shells of the Sorcerers’ former battle-brothers stride beside them, unleashing storms of firepower at their masters’ command as psychic nimbuses crawl over their armour. Sigil-etched battle tanks, Daemon Engines, and braying mutants shrieking praise to the Great Sorcerer complete ritual acts of murderous change, empowering the Thousand Sons’ malign magicks yet further.</p>||

Changehosts of Deceit attack amidst roiling illusions that twist their doomed enemies’ perceptions. Eye-watering veils of sorcery ripple over the battlefield, blurring the foe’s vision and tricking targeting reticules. Waking dreams invade the minds of tank crews until they claw at each other in madness, while others lure enemies along fey-lit paths into ambush. Amidst the insanity, gangle-armed Horrors caper around squads of Rubric Marines, flinging spitting bolts of iridescent warpfire into their perplexed foes while gabbling incantations. Shoals of soul-hungry Screamers are followed as portents of nearby prey by hunting herds of Tzaangors, while other daemons vanish in brimstone bursts only to claw their way back out of the Warp behind their foes. Any enemy attempting to rationalise the anarchic devastation soon finds their ploys and sanity unravelling.</p>||
000001063|TS|Warpmeld Pact|<p class="ShowFluff legend">For the leaders of some thrallbands, the drive to effect excruciating and repeated change upon their staid enemies is an obsession. Whether correcting what they see as realspace’s imperfect reflection of the Warp, spreading mutation as a form of devotion to Tzeentch or earthing corrupting magicks into the foe to stave off their flesh-change, these Warp mages use their sorcery to mould matter to their capricious whims. The Warpmeld Pacts they lead often amass large warherds of Tzaangor beastmen whose Shaman leaders they arrogantly hurl them towards their foes. Mutalith Vortex Beasts lumber forward as line breakers, radiating mutating energies that shatter gun lines, breaches that are then exploited by spearheads of Rubricae and loping Daemon Engines. Amidst waves of mutative magic, the most twisted of the Warpmeld Pact’s servants ripple with rapid change. Wounds reknit or broaden into leering grins; skin thickens into feathered scales, and newly sprouted pseudopods claw at enemies whose hopes of a clean death swiftly vanish.</p>||
000001064|TS|Rubricae Phalanx|<p class="ShowFluff legend">There is no mercy in the hollow-eyed stares of the Thousand Sons’ warriors. To face one of these unholy, haunted figures is to feel the chill grasp of certain doom upon one’s soul. As an army of eldritch automatons, a Rubricae Phalanx is a terrifying immortal mechanism, its every interlocking segment fulfilling its role within the labyrinthine schemes of its sorcerous masters. The Rubricae are expertly wielded by Magnus’ scions, serving as unwavering anvils, in crushing vanguard strikes and circuitous ambushes. These armoured warriors advance in thudding lockstep, the beat of their heavy tread a deathly rhythm of impending execution that comes from all sides. Cursed weapons are raised at a silent command, a blistering salvo of ensorcelled bolts hammering out to send transmorphic flame billowing in all directions. Enemies reduced to glittering ash are ground underfoot. As the Rubricae crash into the survivors, their spirits draw upon ancient skills of conquest to crush the foe, their rune-carved armour blazing with victory.</p>||
000001065|TS|Warpforged Cabal|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Infused with arcane power, their engines growling with occult rhythms, the massed armoured might of a Warpforged Cabal crackles with barely containable empyric energies. Spearheads of rune-carved battle tanks surge along invisible ley lines, absorbing magical potential into sacrificial fetishes as they blast the foe with cannonades of tainted shells. Daemon Engines clamber over the enemy’s desperate barricades to reach their prey, reaching out with eager iron claws, while others soar through sorcery-wracked skies, their contrails burning arcane sigils into the air. Shimmering clouds of phantasms part to reveal the forms of Sekhetar Robots in the enemy’s midst, any panicked return fire pattering from empyric wards. Amidst the destruction, the Cabal’s Warp mages use their web of empowered war engines as reservoirs of sorcery, vampirically tapping their overloaded runes to cast psychic rituals of ever greater catastrophic power.</p>||

000000973|TYR|Tyranid Attack|<b>Amidst the dark of the void, the alien horror of the Tyranids is rendered all the more terrifying. Whether swarming forth to defend their own bio-ships or stalking their prey through the decks of voidships or star forts, the hunting swarms leave none alive.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000974|TYR|Boarding Swarm|<b>When Tyranid hive ships latch onto prey vessels, they unleash tailored swarms of swift vanguard organisms whose purpose is to sow terror amongst the defenders and strike for vital targets such as the enginarium and command bridge.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000975|TYR|Biotide|<b>Whether responding to attacks by hostile boarding parties or spilling into an already-breached prey vessel, these unceasing waves of warrior organisms overrun their victims like a multiplying virus.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000979|TYR|Infestation Swarm|<b>Many doomed voidships have been infested by Genestealers, their corridors and crawlways transformed into the hunting grounds and brood-lairs of monstrous vanguard organisms. Such infestations prove nightmarishly deadly to any unwise enough to board these apparent derelicts.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000982|TYR|Warrior Bioform Onslaught|<p class="ShowFluff legend">None of the synapse-beasts comprising the hive fleets are more prevalent than Tyranid Warriors. Lethal killing machines in their own right, these bioforms serve not only as instruments of destruction but as relay nodes through which the will of the Hive Mind transmits. Armed with an array of devastating weaponised biomorphs, broods of Tyranid Warriors and other bioforms slaughter their way through any resistance and open a path for hordes of Hormagaunts and Termagants to pour in to obliterate all remaining resistance.</p>||
000001057|TYR|Subterranean Assault|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When the hive fleet’s organisms descend, no place is truly safe from their wrath. As the lands swarm and writhe, and the skies are clouded with winged monstrosities, other foes advance unseen below. Mawlocs, Raveners and Trygons burst from the ground to emerge in the midst of clustered defenders, scything apart and devouring screaming victims before they can raise their weapons in defence, sowing crippling fear and confusion through those that witness the unexpected violence.</p>||
000000777|WE|Berzerker Warband|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Comprised of insane transhuman fanatics, monstrous possessed and other horrific killers, World Eaters warbands confront their foes head-on, relying predominantly upon aggression to turn the tide of battle in their favour; this is not to say that they are devoid of tactical and strategic acumen, however. As screaming hordes of Khorne Berzerkers crash into the enemy, armoured vehicles, Daemon Engines and mortal cultists follow the assault, moving swiftly to outflank and envelop foes or seizing key battlefield positions to repel desperate counterattacks. Whether breaking a siege, defending the site of a twisted ritual or simply seeking to annihilate a chosen enemy, World Eater’s warbands are more than capable of adapting their battle plans to the task at hand, so long as blood is spilt and skulls claimed in the name of the Blood God.</p>||
000000977|WE|Boarding Butchers|<b>Whether attacking an enemy voidship, or counterassaulting foes unwise enough to board a World Eaters vessel, these blood-drenched slaughterers reduce their victims to headless carcasses with shocking speed. Such close confines suit these murderous berzerkers perfectly.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000000978|WE|Skullsworn|<b>The elite of the World Eaters burn with the unholy blessings of Khorne. However, such might is not given freely. Storming headlong into the close-quarters carnage of a boarding action is the ideal way in which such empowered warriors can claim the tithe of skulls they owe their Dark God.</b>|Boarding Actions|
000001007|WE|Vessels of Wrath|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When the power of the Warp waxes and Khorne’s worshippers pour into battle in their multitudes, the bloody butchery reaches heights undreamed of. Upon this carmine altar of war, the Khorne champions compete mercilessly to win his favour and feel his forge-hot touch upon their souls. Every savage stride along the Path to Glory sees them hack down more luckless foes. Blood runs in rivers and hoses walls and barricades with arterial sprays as the champions of Khorne strike off heads and carve open bodies, seeking the worthy kill that will – for but the most fleeting of moments – catch the eye of Khorne. Amidst such wanton carnage, even the lowliest devotee of the Blood God can begin their rise to power, their comrades looking on with naked hunger as aspiration becomes a violent reality.</p>||
000001042|WE|Cult of Blood|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Such is the murderous reputation of the World Eaters that countless followers of Khorne are drawn into their orbit. These cultists, augmented by agonising surgeries and possessed by an insatiable desire to kill, howl praise to Khorne as they advance in huge numbers. They are most frenzied and zealous when following to battle the largest and most imposing of the World Eaters’ hellforged war machines. In the presence of titanic gore-encrusted engines of destruction, mortal cultists revel in glorious slaughter, hurling themselves against gun lines and into the meat grinder of melee combat with reckless and ecstatic abandon. Beneath the crushing weight of such numbers and faced with the terrifying presence of the World Eaters’ titanic engines of destruction, the enemy quail and flee or are swept aside in a tempest of horrific bloodshed.</p>||
000001043|WE|Khorne Daemonkin|<p class="ShowFluff legend">When blood is spilt in floods, and the skulls of the World Eaters’ foes are piled high, the barrier between reality and the Warp collapses. From the roiling depths of the Immaterium, Khorne’s infernal legions thunder forth. Horned monstrosities adorned with burnished brass and grisly trophies, these empyric entities know only warfare and carnage. To many World Eaters, there is no greater honour than to fight at the side of such beings. When the blood legions go to battle, they do so in teeming ranks, Bloodletters surging from rent and rift with warp-metal blades and gore-encrusted banners held aloft. The most blessed of World Eaters champions thunder into the fray astride their Juggernaut mounts, daemonic cavalry forming wedges in their wake. Khorne Berzerkers rush into battle alongside packs of Flesh Hounds or in the shadow of colossal Bloodthirsters. As the blood flows, the daemons grow stronger, the force of their onslaught gathering pace and leaving behind them a charnel pit of butchered corpses.</p>||
000001044|WE|Possessed Slaughterband|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Many are the World Eaters warbands who count possessed among their ranks. These warriors, including the Eightbound, are terrifying instruments of destruction and wanton slaughter. Whether advancing on foot through hails of incoming fire or traversing the Warp to emerge amid the enemy lines, the enthralled warriors are deployed as living weapons of destruction to break through the most heavily defended positions, to shatter armour formations or to slaughter the foe’s elite units before they can be brought to bear. To this end, the possessed rely upon daemonic resilience and strength, their altered forms turning aside incoming fire and their monstrous might enabling them to sweep aside any enemies unfortunate enough to stand in their path.</p>||
000001045|WE|Goretrack Onslaught|<p class="ShowFluff legend">Many World Eaters warbands use armoured vehicles to press home their brutal assaults. Land Raiders and Rhino transports grind relentlessly forward, their engines growling like hungry beasts as they crash into enemy infantry, guns blazing wildly as spiked prows gore bodies and armoured tracks mangle unfortunate prey. Having ploughed deep into the enemy formation, assault ramps and doors drop to release waves of Khorne Berzerkers, hulking Eightbound and veteran warriors clad in gore-encrusted Terminator armour. Stunned enemies reel as the assault gathers pace, chainaxes and bolt pistols reaping a terrible tally. The advance is unrelenting and without pity, smashing through obstacles and defences with frightening ease. When the foe lies broken and scattered, the surviving World Eaters mount up again and rumble towards their next target, leaving only carrion in their wake.</p>||
